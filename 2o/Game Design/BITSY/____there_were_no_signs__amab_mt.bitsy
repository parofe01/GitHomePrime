NAME cat dialog

DLG 2
In my house there have only been nintendo consoles, the Wii, DS, 3DS and Switch, I wanted a Wii U but no luck, at the time of the DS, it was easier for my parents for me to have an R4 to save me having to buy games, and as my older cousin no longer used hers, they gave it to me, with all her girl games, There were many that I just didn't get into but there was one especially that I enjoyed playing, I don't remember the name or what it was about, the only thing I remember is that I had fun in the dress up section of the game, I spent a lot of time on it, I didn't understand anything of what was going on but there I was.

The card had low memory and when I asked them for new games they told me I had to choose which ones to delete, they helped me to choose several, half embarrassed I said no to "that" one, knowing what they would say to me and I was told ‚Äòreally? that one? but it's for girls‚Äô, I still have that game, but don't know where is the DS :P

I've always been someone who is easily moved to tears, I just can't help it, once I was even arguing with my aunt, and I couldn't help crying, I couldn't understand why, I didn't want to, I even told her: ‚ÄòI don't understand why I'm crying, I can't control my tears, just ignore them‚Äô.
The death of any character or actor always weighs on me. Or the slightest nostalgia, embarrassment or other emotions, they immediately push me to the limit, nowadays I can avoid bursting into tears but it still affects me. I know that if one day I finally start HRT I will cry uncontrollably xD.

I've been playing Pok√©mon since 2009, in Pok√©mon Pearl and I always played as a guy called Pablo, in Pok√©mon Sun, in 2016, I change the name to Flash, the nick name I use everywhere.
NAME item 7 dialog

DLG c
In 2018, Pok√©mon Shield came out, which I bought on its release date. This was the first game I played choosing to be a girl. I almost didn't, anyone who saw it would criticize it, but I did it. In the end, it's just a character. When I went to show a friend of mine the new game in the series he said to me, "Did you choose the girl? Man, that's not a man's thing," and I felt really bad about that, as if there was something wrong with me, but I didn't give it too much thought.

My parents divorced in 2012/2013, but a few of my mother's things remained at my father's house. In 2018, one summer day, I decided to investigate around the house to see what I could find of my mother's clothes.
NAME Bubble9 dialog

DLG e
I found a couple of bras and a pair of tights, it wasn't much but it was something, I put it all on, then I found a skirt which I put on too, it felt good, even a little exciting (gender euphoria in its early stages can cause this, the body doesn't know how to handle it), after a couple of attempts in which my dog ‚Äã‚Äãalways ended up barking at me until I stopped using her, I left it be for 2 years.

Apparently, people who are not trans (cis people) would not even consider what I just did. If you suggest it to them, there may be a chance that they would accept it as a joke or do it for humor by playing a role or something like Mister Jagger, but it would be very rare that it would be on their own initiative, but rather due to an external suggestion.

In 2019 I got my first crush on TSMR, she was the one, at least 6 people thought we were dating, and for me I wish it was true, but no, she had a boyfriend and when she broke up with him in 2019, she became a lesbian. It was a lost battle, but I didn't want to get away from her, so I continued by her side, and to this day I am still friends with her.
NAME Bubble12 dialog

I was really afraid that she would hate me for what I was going to ask her for, but I dared and after gaining a lot of confidence with her, I asked her if I could borrow some of her clothes, I told her about my interest in trying them on, luckily it went well, and since then she has given me some things that she was going to throw away.

It didn't take me too long to buy my first feminine item of clothing after trying my crush's leggings, they felt great to wear so I couldn't help but buy some leggings, at home I used it as an excuse to wear them under my pants because of the cold winter weather so they wouldn't show, I've already gone out in them, I've even gone to Florida once in them on one of those themed Fridays we did.

One day I finally dared to go out dressed completely as a woman, a total of 2 times to date, both times I was completely terrified of what they could do to me, on one I got caught on a bus and it was a mistake because by not covering my face it was clear that I was a boy in women's clothing.
NAME Bubble16 dialog

DLG l
The second time was when I went to class for a costume party when I came back from DANA. That time I corrected my mistake and wore a mask, black leggings to hide white stockings and a jacket to hide the Nurse Joy uniform I had been wearing since my crush's house who let me change there before leaving, despite walking through the streets of Catarroja with pink heels.

More and more often, I wish I had a female body, I have opened up to my mother, and she showed a complete rejection response, my aunt on the other hand, although I have not told her directly, I have worn skirts inside the house with her there and she has only told me to take it off because my father was coming home, at first she does not seem to care but I do not know what to think.
